.. _configure-project:

#####################
Project Configuration
#####################

Generic settings for the project are contained in the ``./config-COPYME`` 
directory. Copy this directory to a new directory called ``config``, which 
will be used by your project instance::

    $ cd /opt/cyphon/cyphondock/
    $ cp -R config-COPYME config

The ``config`` directory contains settings for:

    * :ref:`environmental-variables`
    * :ref:`django-config`
    * :ref:`nginx-config`
    * :ref:`logstash-config`
    * :ref:`elasticsearch-config`


.. _environmental-variables:

*********************
Environment Variables
*********************

The ``./config/env/cyphon.env`` file contains default settings for 
superusers created for various services. Use a text editor to 
change the usernames and passwords to more secure options.

You can read more about environment variables in `Docker's documentation <https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/>`_.


.. _django-config:

******
Django
******

Cyphon's backend is based on the `Django`_ web framework. Settings for the 
Cyphon Django project are found in the ``./config/cyphon/settings`` 
directory.

The ``conf.py`` file contains settings specific to your Cyphon instance. 
Using your favorite text editor, edit the ``conf.py`` file with the IP 
address and/or domain name for your host machine::

    HOST_SETTINGS = {
       'ALLOWED_HOSTS': ['example.com', '127.0.0.1'],
       'CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST': ['example.com', '127.0.0.1'],
    }

You should also change the Django ``SECRET_KEY`` to something unique. 
You can generate one `here <http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/>`__.

The ``base.py``, ``dev.py``, and ``prod.py`` files contain more general 
settings for Django and other third party apps used by Cyphon. At a 
minimum, you should configure the `BASE_URL` setting in the ``dev.py`` 
and ``prod.py`` files. You can read more about Django's settings in  
`Django's documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/settings/>`__.

.. _cyclops-config:

=======
Cyclops
=======

Cyclops is an optional frontend that helps to mange alerts and data from
Cyphon in real time. This product is under a different license than Cyphon
outline `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/master/LICENSE.txt>`__.
Make sure to take a quick look over it before using Cyclops in your use case.

Cyclops is configured with the ``conf.py`` file in the Django settings::

    CYCLOPS = {
        'ENABLED': True,
        'VERSION': '0.4.0',
        'CDN_FORMAT': 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/{0}/dist/cyclops.{1}',
        'MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN': '',
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_ENABLED': False,
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_PATH': os.path.abspath(os.path.join(PROJ_DIR, '../../cyclops/build')),
        'LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME': 'cyclops',
        'LOCAL_CSS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.css',
        'LOCAL_JS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.js',
    }

The only thing to change in these settings is ``MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN``.
This is required to show maps with locations and to get geolocation data.
You can signup for an access token
`here <https://www.mapbox.com/studio/signup/>`__.

The next optional step would be to setup push notifications for Cyclops,
which is explained in :ref:`push-notifications`.

.. _nginx-config:

*****
Nginx
*****

Settings for the `Nginx <https://www.nginx.com/>`_ web server are in the
``./config/nginx/nginx.conf`` file. You can use the default settings if 
you like.


.. _logstash-config:

********
Logstash
********

Cyphon receives data from logs using `Logstash`_ and `RabbitMQ`_. Logstash receives the logs and passes them to RabbitMQ, where Cyphon consumes them.

To configure Logstash, you can use the example configuration files in ``./config/logstash``. See `Logstash's documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/config-setting-files.html>`__ for more information on these files. The Docker Compose files are already configured to create a Logstash container based on these configs.

.. warning:: If you changed the RabbitMQ settings in the ``cyphon.env`` 
             file, you will need to make sure your ``logstash.conf`` 
             file reflects those changes.


.. _elasticsearch-config:

*************
Elasticsearch
*************

Settings for the `Elasticsearch`_ search engine are in the ``./config/elasticsearch/`` folder. You can use the default settings if you like.
